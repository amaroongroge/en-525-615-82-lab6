= EN.525.615 - Lab 6 Assignment

== Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment link

The GitHub Classroom Assignment for this Lab can be found here: https://classroom.github.com/a/0ifxLX2v

== Overview

You will make a simple video game console using both the primary development board as the console itself. You will implement a simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris[Tetris-like game]. This will require you to display graphics on the LCD, generate sounds with the DAC/Amp combo, and interface with buttons/joystick.

=== Requirements

Your video game console should:

** Display graphics with a minimum level of complexity
** Interface the Funduino Joystick Shield to the Nucleo WB55 board
** Log control inputs to the UART
** Implement a simple audio system to play a tune
*** Be able to play single tones with with a selectable waveform: sine, square, and triangle waves
*** Be able to play different tones (meaning different frequencies of sound)

== Hardware Setup

=== Funduino Joystick Shield

Find information by mining the Internet for your joystick.  Not everyone has the same joystick, so look at the model number, find the specs, understand/plan how you want to interface it, make a plan, and then test.  You might consider testing by sending output to the UART first, before trying to incorporate in your game.

=== Audio

==== MAX98357 I2S Amp Breakout Board

This board has a I2S driven Digital Analog Converter and audio amplifier combination chip on it which greatly simplifies generating audio signals from a microcontroller.

Just like the LCD, hardware-wise there are a few things that *must* be hooked up:

1. Power and Ground
* Make sure to connect Vin to the *5.0* volts from the microcontroller (We are still using 3.3V logic - this setup will give more power for the amp)

2. I2S Signals
* LRC (Left/Right Clock) - this is the pin that tells the amplifier when the data is for the left channel and when its for the right channel
* BCLK (Bit Clock) - This is the pin that tells the amplifier when to read data on the data pin.
* DIN (Data In) - This is the pin that has the actual data coming in, both left and right data are sent on this pin, the LRC pin indicates when left or right is
 being transmitted
* Note: The MAX98357 doesn't require a Master Clock
* Just like the LCD it is up to you to locate appropriate pins for this interface since you must find the pins that can be configured to the I2S alternate function

And some that do not need to be hooked up:

1. Mode
* The breakout board by design puts this in stereo average which is what we want
2. Gain
* Gain refers to how much amplification the signal will get and by default it is set to 9 dB which is reasonable for this lab. If you experience excessive disto
rtion or other similar issues than consider lowering the gain by jumpering this to Vin
* Table 8 in the MAX98357 datasheet lists all gain configurations

==== Amplifier and Speaker

In your kit you have a 1 Watt 8Î© speaker. This is connected to the screw terminal on the breakout board. Make sure to pay attention to the polarity of the
speaker when doing this (Red wire to `+`, Black wire to `-`).

In order to build the final project, you must be able to produce simple tones and melodies. In this lab you will create a system for playing these tones and stringing them together.

NOTE: The SAI peripheral should be configured to use the I2S/PCM Protocol and be driven using DMA in circular buffer mode. Using the SAI in a polling configuration will be incur too much CPU overhead.

==== Pure Tones and Melodies

You will create several sets of samples each of which will represent a single "note". See reference 9 for more information on what notes actually look like. Basically you will have several pre-programmed frequencies that can be played through the I2S DAC. Since this device works on the principal of outputting a fixed number of samples per second, you must craft the samples to produce the proper frequencies. You will then play sequences of these notes to produce simple tunes.

You must implement the following waveforms:

* Square
* Triangle
* Sawtooth
* Sine
* Random Noise (frequency doesn't matter here, but perhaps try out the random number generator peripheral in the stm32)

The first four have distinct "sounds" and will be useful for making tunes. While noise is good for some types of sound effects (and heavily used in old video games). The following figure shows their shapes.

TIP: A good site for getting music in musical alphabet notation is https://noobnotes.net/[noobnotes]. Each letter corresponds to a frequency, and some letters are either in a higher octave or lower octave which are respectively a doubling or halving of frequency. A well optimized function for generating these samples will be useful if you don't want to store a large amount of individual notes in flash.
Some ideas: Mario Theme - https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/, Happy Birthday - https://noobnotes.net/happy-birthday-traditional/

Your game should produce some sort of sound, based on the action in the game.  You should also have a short tune at the start-up of the game.

=== FreeRTOS usage

FreeRTOS usage is *encouraged* but optional.

== Final Product

At the end of this lab, you should have a Tetris-like video game that displays graphics on the LCD, allows the user to control via the joystick, plays sounds (a tune at the beginning and sound effects during the game), keeps score and displays on the LCD, and logs interactions via the UART port.

This is a good deal of work.  Do not wait until the last minute to tackle this project.  Break the development into manageable pieces, use Git Issues to help keep track of what needs to be done, and ask questions as you go.

For the final report, you should include a *short* video demonstrating the play of your game.

TIP: Optionally, you can add whatever *additional* features you like to this. If you implement features above and beyond this baseline we will add extra credit equivalent to the effort/creativity put in to them. You can not get over 100, but what the extra credit will do is allow you lose points in some other areas and still make it possible to get a perfect score. The maximum extra points available is *10 points*, so one full letter grade. To get this max amount the features added must be exceptional.
